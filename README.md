# Interactive Physics Simulations with Matter.js and p5.js ðŸŽ®âœ¨

This project demonstrates the power of Matter.js and p5.js to create physics-based simulations and interactive web applications. The application includes dynamic objects that respond to user interactions with realistic behaviors such as collision detection, gravity, and object movement. Itâ€™s an ideal starting point for anyone interested in exploring game physics, interactive design, or JavaScript-based simulations.

Features
â€¢	Realistic Physics: Leverages Matter.js for accurate physics simulations.
 
â€¢	Interactive: Users can interact with objects, drag them, and watch them react.
 
â€¢	Visual Effects: Built with p5.js for smooth rendering and animations.
 
â€¢	Customizable: Easily modify elements for personalized gameplay or simulation experiments.

Technologies Used
	
 â€¢	Matter.js: A 2D physics engine for creating realistic simulations.

 â€¢	p5.js: A JavaScript library that makes coding interactive graphics and animations easy.
